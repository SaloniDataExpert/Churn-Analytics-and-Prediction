# Churn Analytics and Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using data from various sources. Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for businesses aiming to retain their customer base. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, we aim to identify patterns and key factors contributing to churn and build predictive models to forecast future churn.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Gather and preprocess customer data from various sources.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data through visualization and statistical analysis to identify patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features that can improve the performance of churn prediction models.
- **Model Development**: Develop and train machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and techniques to ensure accuracy and robustness.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model for practical use in predicting churn and informing retention strategies.

## Dataset Details
- **Data Sources**: Customer transaction history, demographic data, customer service interactions, and more.
- **Variables**: Customer demographics, transaction details, engagement metrics, customer service records, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Churn status (binary: churned or not churned)

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregate data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to uncover insights and relationships within the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer new features that capture important aspects of customer behavior and demographics.
5. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the final model and integrate it with business systems for real-time churn prediction.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Platforms**: Jupyter Notebook, FastAPI (for deployment)
